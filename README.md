# Opengl Tutorials

A repo for storing code as I work through the tutorials at [learnopengl.com](https://learnopengl.com). The only interesting aspect is that the whole thing is written in plain C.

## Installation

Only a few dependencies are required for installation.
- GLFW: This is most easily obtained using your package manager to install the relevant package (eg. `yum install glfw-devel`)
- glad: Visit [the official site](https://glad.dav1d.de/) to generate appropriate source files. Download the zip file somewhere, extract, and edit Makefiles as appropriate with the location of your glad install.

## Credit to Other Projects

stb.h and linmath.h are packaged with this repo (for the sake of simplicity). These can always be updated by visiting the relevant project pages and copying new versions of these headers into this repo. See https://github.com/nothings/stb and https://github.com/datenwolf/linmath.h.git.
